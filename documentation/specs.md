## Products Suite

### Overview of 0fx Product Suite

The 0fx product suite is designed to provide a comprehensive and innovative approach to blockchain investment and governance. Our suite includes the 0fx Governance platform, 0fx Dashboard, and a unique 0fx Swap mechanism.

#### 0fx Governance

- **Custom Governance Portal**: This portal serves as a platform for users to monitor the progression of our protocol. 
- **Roadmap Tracking**: Users can view the planned trajectory of the protocol, including past milestones and future goals.
- **Execution Updates**: Real-time information on ongoing developments and how they align with the planned roadmap.
- **Financial Transparency**: Comprehensive data regarding the protocolâ€™s financial aspects, ensuring full transparency for users.

#### 0fx Dashboard

- **Portfolio Management and Strategy Analysis**: The dashboard offers users a holistic view of their positions within the investment 'buckets' and their overall portfolio.
- **Strategy Performance Monitoring**: Users can track the performance of their chosen strategies in real-time.
- **Personal Bucket Creation**: Allows for the customization of investment 'buckets' to suit individual preferences.

#### 0fx Swap

Use the liquidity to lend and earn extra APR.

- **All-Token Swap Capability**: The swap mechanism facilitates transactions across all types of tokens, utilizing an innovative process that involves synthetic tokens.
- **Swap Process**:
    - When a user wishes to swap, for example, USDT for USDC, the USDT is initially lent to a lending protocol, generating a synthetic version (sUSDT).
    - This sUSDT is then swapped for the equivalent synthetic token (sUSDC).
    - Finally, the sUSDC is used to reclaim the native token (USDC) from the lending protocol, which is then transferred to the user.
- **Lending Protocol Integration**: Our protocol leverages lending protocols for actual liquidity storage, enhancing the efficiency and security of transactions.
- **Synthetic Token Utilization**:
    - Users can deposit an asset (e.g., ETH) into 0fx contracts, which is then lent via a lending protocol.
    - In return, the user receives a synthetic token equivalent (sETH), representing their position in the protocol.
- **Yield Generation**:
    - The swap feature includes an option to use LP tokens for staking, allowing users to earn rewards from the lending protocol.
    - This yield generation is a key component of the swap DApp, offering an additional avenue for user benefit.

## 0fx Swap: Technical Requirements and Goals

### Current Challenges
1. **Single-Usage Liquidity Allocation**: Presently, liquidity is restricted to a singular application, limiting its potential utility.
2. **Low Appeal of Liquidity Provision**: The current model for liquidity provisioning lacks sufficient incentives, making it unattractive to most users.
3. **Minimal Fee Returns for Liquidity Providers**: Liquidity providers currently earn a fee ranging only between 0.3% to 1% on the liquidity they contribute.

### Vision
1. **Dual Utility of Liquidity**: Strategically utilize liquidity for multiple purposes, enhancing its overall efficacy.
2. **Optimized Liquidity Allocation**: Commit 100% of our liquidity to various protocols, thereby significantly improving liquidity availability for market loans.
3. **Rewarding Swap Mechanism**: Transform the swap process into a more rewarding experience for participants.
4. **Enhanced Rewards for Liquidity Providers**: Introduce additional income sources for liquidity providers, elevating their reward structure.
5. **Increased Liquidity for Lending Protocols**: Augment the liquidity available to lending protocols, contributing to a more robust lending environment.

7. **Inclusive Onboarding Vision**: Attract a diverse range of users with the promise of a rewarding Web3 experience.

### Success Metrics
1. **Enhanced Liquidity Provider Rewards**: We can display 3.5% to 20% depending on the pair of tokens especially if we welcome exotic tokens. And you have to check but even for ETH you can have 3.5% on Lido and USDT even more on other Protocols.
2. **Total Value Lent to Protocols**: Aspire to lend an amount close to the total TVL (Total Value Locked) across different protocols.
3. **Coverage of Reputed Protocols**: Expand our reach to cover as many reputable protocols as possible.
